As you've already seen, coding can be quite challenging. Just getting your environment up and running can be difficultâ€”not to mention solving tricky problems using arrays and objects. At this point, you're likely filled to the brim with new knowledge.

At its core, programming is really about solving problems. Everything that you've learned about so far, from Visual Studio Code to reduce(), can help you solve problems. One of the joys of programming is to be presented with tough problems and to have to create solutions for them, leveraging what you know. This project will require you to do just that.

Although previous assessments have been narrow in scope, this is a bit broader. You will need to leverage all the skills that you've learned so far to build a variety of complex functions. As you work on this project, understand that you will get stuck. When that happens, take a break. Reach out to other Thinkful students. Review the material that you've covered so far. You will make your way to a solution.

While it'll be tough, you'll be successful in this assessment just like you have on those that preceded this. Good luck and have fun!
